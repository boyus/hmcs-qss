Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from quantum state space

------
This repository contains the MATLAB code that I wrote during my M.Sc. thesis project "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling from quantum state space" from August 2014 to May 2015, under the supervision of Prof. Berthold-Georg Englert in Centre for Quantum Technologies and Department of Physics, National University of Singapore.

###### MATLAB code for two-qubit states
* Cholesky Decomposition with Primitive Prior: `code/cholesky_2qb_flat.m`
* Cholesky Decomposition with Jeffreys Prior or Hedged Prior: `code/cholesky_2qb_non_flat.m`
* Spectral Decomposition with Primitive Prior: `code/spect_2qb_flat.m`
* Fidelity and Distance: `code/Fidelity_Distance.m`

Code is released under the MIT license.
